# Transformers

TensorFlow implementations of the following papers:
- [Attention Is All You Need](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1706.03762)
- [On Layer Normalization in the Transformer Architecture](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2002.04745)
- [On Layer Normalizations and Residual Connections in Transformers](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2206.00330v1)
- [ResiDual: Transformer with Dual Residual Connections](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2304.14802)

Also includes a detailed [guide](https://github.com/kcbhatraju/transformers/blob/main/Transformer%20Details.pdf) on transformer implementations clarifying some common misconceptions that I haven't seen explained well in other sources.
